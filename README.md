# Full-stack-E-Commerce
This project focuses mainly on Back-End and uses Django Framework. All the front-end is made using Bootstrap.
It belongs to a bigger project which will have 1 more blog application alongwith E-Commerce.

> Note: This application uses sqlite3 which is making it harder to deploy. It will be hosted soon and the link will be provided asap!
